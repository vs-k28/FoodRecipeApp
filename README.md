The recipe items are displayed in cards. Each card consists of an image of the recipe, the recipe name, and a "Learn more" button. When a user clicks on the "Learn more" button, a popup will show the "recipe details", such as the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, time taken to complete, and servings.
